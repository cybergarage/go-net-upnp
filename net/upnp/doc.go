	err := cp.Start()
	...
	defer cp.Stop()
	...
	err = cp.SearchRootDevice()
	...
	for n, dev := range cp.GetRootDevices() {
		...
	}

The control point can post actions in the service, and get the action response:

	service, err := dev.GetServiceByType("xxxx")
	...
	action, err := service.GetActionByName("xxxx")
	...
	action.SetArgumentString("xxxx", "xxxx")
	err = action.Post()
